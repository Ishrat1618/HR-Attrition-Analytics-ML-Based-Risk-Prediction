# HR-Attrition-Analytics-ML-Based-Risk-Prediction

## 📌 Problem Statement
Employee attrition is a critical challenge for organizations, leading to increased hiring costs, loss of expertise, and reduced productivity.  
The objective of this project is to analyze historical HR data to identify attrition patterns, understand key drivers behind employee exits, and proactively predict employees who are at high risk of leaving the organization.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Analyze employee attrition trends using historical HR data  
- Identify key factors influencing employee exits  
- Build a machine learning model to predict attrition risk  
- Visualize insights using interactive dashboards  
- Present findings through business-focused storytelling  

## 📂 Dataset Description
- Dataset: HR Employee Attrition Dataset  
- Records: ~1470 employees  
- Features include:
  - Demographics (Age, Gender, Department)
  - Compensation (Monthly Income, Salary Band)
  - Work factors (OverTime, WorkLifeBalance, Job Satisfaction)
  - Attrition status (Yes / No)

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Excel** – Data cleaning, preprocessing, and KPI creation  
- **SQL (MySQL)** – Querying attrition patterns and business metrics  
- **Python** – Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning  
- **Machine Learning** – Logistic Regression for attrition risk prediction  
- **Power BI** – Interactive ML-driven HR dashboards  
- **Tableau** – Business storytelling using Tableau Stories
 
 ## 🔄 Project Workflow
1. Data cleaning and preparation using Excel  
2. Exploratory analysis and KPI generation  
3. SQL-based business queries for attrition insights  
4. Machine learning model development for attrition prediction  
5. Creation of ML-based attrition risk scores and categories  
6. Visualization through Power BI dashboards  
7. Business storytelling using Tableau Stories  
8. Final insights and HR recommendations  

 ## 🤖 Machine Learning Approach
- Target Variable: AttritionFlag (1 = Attrition, 0 = No Attrition)
- Model Used: Logistic Regression
- Key Features:
  - Monthly Income
  - Years at Company
  - Overtime
  - Job Satisfaction
  - Work-Life Balance
- Output:
  - Attrition Risk Score (probability)
  - Risk Category (Low / Medium / High)

## 📊 Dashboards & Storytelling
### Power BI Dashboard
- ML-driven KPI cards (Total Employees, Attrition Rate, High-Risk Employees)
- Department-wise and overtime-based attrition analysis
- Interactive filters for HR exploration
### Tableau Story
- Step-by-step HR attrition story
- Identifies where attrition occurs, why it happens, and who is at risk
- Ends with actionable HR recommendations

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Overall attrition rate is approximately 16%  
- Certain departments experience significantly higher attrition  
- Lower salary bands show higher employee exits  
- Overtime strongly correlates with increased attrition  
- ML model identifies a small but critical group of high-risk employees  

## 🎯 Business Recommendations
- Focus retention efforts on high-attrition departments  
- Review compensation strategies for lower salary bands  
- Reduce excessive overtime to prevent burnout  
- Use ML-based risk scores to proactively engage high-risk employees  
- Continuously monitor attrition using dashboards  

## ✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates an end-to-end HR analytics solution combining data analysis, machine learning, visualization, and business storytelling.  
It highlights how data-driven insights and predictive modeling can support proactive HR decision-making and employee retention strategies.
